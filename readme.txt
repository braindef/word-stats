A suite of word counters, keyword counters and readability analysis for your blog.

== Description ==

Word Stats adds a suite of linguistic diagnostics to help you keep track of your content and improve its quality.

The reports page lets you select an author and period to analyze, and displays:

* The total word count.
* The number and percentage of posts of each post type.
* The top 20 keywords.
* The percentage of posts of basic, intermediate and advanced readability level.
* A graph with monthly word counts for each post type.
* Diagnostics tables, with links to edit the posts that may be too short, too long, too difficult, too simple, lack relevant keywords or abuse certain keywords.

You can display the total word counts for each post type in your dashboard, widget areas and inside your posts with the &#91;wordcounts&#93; shortcode.

Word Stats also extends the info area of the post edit form with these live stats:

* Relevant keywords. Common words can be blacklisted with regular expressions in the settings page.
* A more accurate word count.
* Color coded readability tests: Automated Readability Index, Coleman-Liau Index and LIX.
* Total characters, alphanumeric characters, words and sentences.
* Characters per word, characters per sentence, words per sentence.

Additionally, an extra column with the readability level of each post can be displayed in the manage posts list.

Word Stats includes basic support for Unicode scripts, including cyrillic, greek, arabic, hindi and japanese (mileage may vary).

Spanish and Catalan translations are bundled with the plugin.

Requires WordPress 3.0 and PHP 5.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

**What do the readability numbers and colors mean?**

For ARI and CLI, they are the U.S. grade level of the text. Roughly, grade level 1 corresponds to ages 6-8, grade 8 to 14 years old, grade 12 to 17 years old. The color code is 0-8: green; 8-12: yellow; 12-16: orange; 16-20: red; +20: purple.

For LIX:

* below 25: Children's Books (green)
* 25 - 30: Simple texts (green)
* 30 - 40: Normal Text / Fiction (yellow)
* 40 - 50: Factual information, such as Wikipedia (orange)
* 50 - 60: Technical texts (red)
* over 60: Specialist texts / research / dissertations (purple)

Each index uses a different algorithm:

* ARI is based on word length and words per sentence.
* CLI is based on characters per 100 words, excluding non-word characters, and sentences per 100 words
* LIX is based on average words between pauses (periods, colons, semicolons, etc.) and average words longer than 6 characters.

Check [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Readability_test](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Readability_test) for more information.

**Why other common tests aren't included?**

These three indexes don't rely on syllable counting, which is a bit more complicated and language dependent.

**How accurate are the indexes?**

Word Stats uses simple algorithms. For fairly ordinary English texts they will closely match human counting; for example, the algorithm for Coleman-Liau produces the same result for the example piece in the Wikipedia article. The margin of error will be greater for short pieces with dashes and apostrophes or in other languages, but they should be still good indicators.

**Do the indexes really reflect how easy is the text?**

They try to reflect how easy the text is to read. You can write an article about relativity in simple English and it will be rated as low level.

**Why the live counters seem to lag?**

The calculations are refreshed every 5 seconds.

**How does Word Stats pick the relevant keywords for the live stats?**

It shows any keyword that appears at least three times and at least 1/5 times the top keyword. Words blacklisted in the settings page are excluded.

Post tags can be counted optionally as keywords. They are added when the post is loaded. If you add new tags, save the post and reload it.

**The anchors for the total word counts in the dashboard are blank**

They are just for style consistence.
